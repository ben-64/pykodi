Small script allowing to switch easily between audios/subbtitles of a movie/tvshow running on a Kodi system.

My daughters watch their cartoons in french, and I am watching movies in english. Kodi can be configured either to play by default in french, or in english but it can't be configured to play videos from this folder in a language, and from that folder in another one... 

I am fed up to change audio/subtitles every time I want to play a video, so I coded this script and bind it to a kind of [remote control](https://www.time0ut.org/blog/posts/adafruit_keyboard/) I built. Now I've just to push a button.
